	<br>

	<ul>
		<li>I reserve the right to deny service whether that be due to the submitter’s incompetence, not providing payment, not providing enough information, etc.</li>
		<li>The works are ONLY FOR PERSONAL USE. Any commercial usage of these can create issues and should be charged much more.</li>

		<li>Any of the work provided for use on the commission is to be under the Creative Commons license or should have been discussed with the original artist before submitting a form. Otherwise, any legal responsibility is yours should there ever be any legal issues.</li>
